    <p>Artificial intelligence is a surging field in computer science and is said to revolutionize medicine in the near
        future. However, this AI hype and its unrealistic fantasies on media could be misleading. As medical students,
        knowing the frontiers and limitations of current artificial intelligence research is crucial for establishing a
        correct understanding of this field and creating novel medical AI applications.</p>
