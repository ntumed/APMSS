										<p>Our College, College of Medicine, was established as a training institute of Taipei Hospital in 1897 in the Japanese colonial era.

It is now the oldest and most prestigious medical college in Taiwan, which cultivates over 150 medical students every year.</p>
										<p>Within the College, the medical school offers a 6+2 year program including 6 years of undergraduate medical program and 2 years of postgraduate training. Most graduates from the College of Medicine will undergo training of residents in National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and become a doctor as well as a scholar in the medical community which promote the development of medical treatment and education.</p>
										<p>The goal of our medical school is the making of a competent clinical scholar, who is not only a medical doctor, but also one that can serve the society, lead the medical community, and contribute to the betterment of humankind.</p>
